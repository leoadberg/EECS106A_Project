# Introduction

The continued growth in collaborative efforts between humans and robots has a multitude of applications ranging from domestic household tasks such as lifting furniture to building habitats on other planets. As a result, the field of human-robot collaboration and interaction has become increasingly relevant in both industry and research. Our project, RAWB, wishes to delve deeper into the field of responsive collaboration, where feedback between both parties is exchanged in real time. Specifically, our primary objective is to be able to comfortably balance a static object in a tray suspended on one end by a human and on the other by a robotic arm in 3 degrees of freedom (DOF).

## Describe any hardware you used or built. Illustrate with pictures and diagrams. What parts did you use to build your solution? 

Our hardware was a mix of borrowed materials from Professor Francesco Borrelliâ€™s Model Predictive Control (MPC) lab and custom designed and manufactured in the Jacobs and Invention Lab Makerspaces. The Universal Robotics (UR5e) robotic arm, and camera, was lent to us from the MPC lab. On the other hand, we designed and lasercut the tray and cart and printed the two end-effectors and end-effector mount for the arm. We designed two end-effectors with the intent of testing both a rigid C-gripper and a flexible, and as a result, underactuated, chain link design.

## Describe any software you wrote in detail. Illustrate with diagrams, flow charts, and/or other appropriate visuals. This includes launch files, URDFs, etc. 

## How does your complete system work? Describe each step.
