# Introduction

The continued growth in collaborative efforts between humans and robots has a multitude of applications ranging from domestic household tasks such as lifting furniture to building habitats on other planets. As a result, the field of human-robot collaboration and interaction has become increasingly relevant in both industry and research. Our project, RAWB, wishes to delve deeper into the field of responsive collaboration, where feedback between both parties is exchanged in real time. Specifically, our primary objective is to be able to comfortably balance a static object in a tray suspended on one end by a human and on the other by a robotic arm in 3 degrees of freedom (DOF).
